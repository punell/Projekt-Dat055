The land has changed, there’s something foul in the air, the vampires has returned. Centuries ago the they were driven out of Transylvania by the Knights of the Square Table, an ancient order of Transylvanian knights who swore to defend the lands against all forms of half-breed. But as the years passed, and half-breeds were nowhere to be seen, the order of these gallant knights withdrew from Transylvania. The stories of these brave knights and the half-breed incursion became nothing more than a myth. You are one of the last knights of the square table, and your missions is to drive the half-breed out of Transylvania once and for all, to do this you must face Dracula. Dracula is the incarnation of evil, he wishes more than anything to end the reign of men, you have to stop him. Raise your sword and sally forth, your destiny awaits, knight!
